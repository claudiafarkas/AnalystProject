# COVID-19 Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing COVID-19 data, sourced from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The primary objective is to derive insightful analytics and visualizations about the pandemic's impact across different countries and time periods.

## Data Source
Dataset: COVID-19 Deaths and Cases
Source: Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
Content: The dataset includes variables like total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, etc., across various countries and dates.

## Tools Used
- SQL: For initial data querying and manipulation.
- Microsoft Excel: For further data transformation and preparation.
- Tableau: To create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Project Structure
- /sql_queries: Contains SQL scripts used for initial data extraction and manipulation.
- /excel_files: Stores transformed data in Excel format.
- /tableau_dashboards: Tableau workbook files with final visualizations.

## Workflow
- Data Extraction: Using SQL queries to filter, sort, and clean the data as required.
- Data Translation: Exporting SQL results into Excel for additional data manipulation, such as pivoting, vlookups, and calculations.
- Visualization: Developing interactive dashboards in Tableau using the Excel data. Focus on trends, comparisons, and geographic distributions.

## Key Visualizations
Trend analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.
Comparative analysis of different countries' pandemic responses.
Vaccination progress across different regions.
